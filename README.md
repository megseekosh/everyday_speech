# everyday_speech

Code to replicate results from:

Bursty, irregular speech input to preschoolers predicts vocabulary size. (*under review*) 

# datasets

* `dataframes/everyday_cds_ods.csv` - used in `burst_detection_v1.py` to compute measures of burstiness 

* `dataframes/everyday_cds_ods_burstiness.csv` - dataframe to replicate child-directed speech results in  

* `dataframes/` - 

* `dataframes/` -

# scripts to process LENA .its files
#### Note that these scripts were adapted from scripts also located in the [HomeBank Git Repo](https://github.com/HomeBankCode)

* `get_its_info.py` - extract basic metadata such as child age and gender from LENA .its file preamble

* `get_speech_clips.py` - extract data about ambient speech from LENA .its files (FAN, MAN) for use in supp. materials III

* `get_CTC_clips.py` - same as above, but to get counts and timestamps of converstational turns for use in supp. materials II

# scripts to prepare .its files for the sleep and child-directed speech classifier
#### SPOGLab research assistant Madurya Suresh assisted with this analysis!

* `0_custom_epoch.py` - reads .its files and outputs .csv files in the format the child directed speech classifier needs to receive; epoch duration can be modified (e.g. 5-min, 60-second); note that these are custom epochs, and not the ones generated by LENA

* `1_pipeline.py` - reads generated .csv files and places them into online classifier using Selenium Webdriver; outputs csv files containing results from the classifier

* `2_name_files.py` - renames the .csv files generated from `1_pipeline.py`

# modeling and scripts to replicate results
  
* `1_loading.Rmd` - process the .csv files for metadata, as well as measures reported in supplementary materials II and III

* `1_modeling.Rmd` - replicate the methods tables and results section in the manuscript, as well as supplementary materials II and III

* `burst_detection_v1.py` - script to generate `dataframes/everyday_cds_ods_burstiness.csv` as well as timeseries plots of burstiness
